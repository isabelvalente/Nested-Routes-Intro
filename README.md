# Sparta-Advanced-Models-Lab-MVC

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to build a blog using Rails nested routes. I had to make sure the seven restful routes worked after the model relationships were set and the routes were nested.


## Implementation
The funcitonality has been implemented using Ruby on Rails.

```

## Challenges
The biggest challenge to this project was to adjust the paths after I nested the routes. It was hard to understand some of the error messages. But as this exercise exposed me to many errors I have learnt a lot about how to fix certain errors.
